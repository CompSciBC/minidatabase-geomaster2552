Assignment 2
CS300
Fall 2025

While implementing the Engine, I found it challenging at first to
understand how the data structures interacted with each other.
After studying the files and trying some implementations, I began to grasp it.
It was also challenging to understand how cmpOut was supposed to work for
the methods until I looked at the BST file and saw the resetMetrics method.
Once I called that method before counting comparisons, cmpOut returned the expected number.
By far, the most challenging piece for me was implementing prefixByLast.
Once I understood how string comparisons work, I was able to use
the rangeApply method to find the correct last name and pass a Lambda function
to copy the appropriate indices to the output.

I feel that I learned a lot from this assignment particularly how to integrate
multiple data structures and types as well as how to use Lambda functions.
Learning to use GitHub was also beneficial, and I feel that I understand the
platform better now than I did before.
